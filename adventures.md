# Weekly Updates

I try my best to document my journey into the bootcamp.
Very excited, good content, definitely worth a look

## WEEK 1 -- 15 FEB

- Into to git, which was not needed.

  - I have strong interest into advance features, working in a small team of developers.

- No code -- Lots of digging and setting up of nvim through LazyVim.
  - configuring and understand lsps, quicklist and optimising for development.
  - keymaps are also very significant for easing

# Weekly Updates

I try my best to document my journey into the [bootcamp](https://metana.io).
Very excited, good content, definitely worth a look

## WEEK 1 -- 15 FEB [^1]

- Into to git, which was not needed.

  - I have strong interest into advance features, working in a small team of developers.

- No code -- Lots of digging and setting up of nvim through LazyVim.

  - configuring and understand lsps, quicklist and optimising for development.
  - keymaps are also very significant for easing

- Glimps of ERC20 tokens

## WEEK 2 -- 24 FEB

- longer then expected, but solid understanding into what a ERC20 Token is and its derivitives.

* DIVE INTO erc720 token, NFT. {ownerAddress}{nftAddress}.json

- ** Reflection (WEEKLY TAGS) **
  [^1]: Insights and interest in nvim. I can taste the power, first implementation of markdown using the syntax
